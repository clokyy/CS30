Make a submission

Assignment  Goal: This program was designed to teach you how to define, input, and output a variable.

Project Description: Define, input, and print some variables and their values.

Files Needed : None

Comment Requirements:

Program name: (The name you gave the program)

Student name: (Your name)

Date: (The date you completed the program)

Program Description:

 

***Remember you will need to start your own Java project and class for your assignment.  The pre-made program is just a guide.

 You will need to write code that will perform the following:

Using the code below as a start create a program that the user inputs and the program outputs two of the following variables: integer, double, (you can also explore float, short., byte, and long.)

Add code that will add each of the pairs of variables together at the end of the program. 
A sample output for number 1 is:

integer one = 2

integer two = 3

double one = 4.0

double two = 5.0

A sample output for number 2 is:

intOne + intTwo = 5

doubleOne + doubleTwo = 9.0

import static java.lang.System.*;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Input

{

  public static void main (String[] args)

  {

      Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);

      int intOne, intTwo; 

      System.out.print("Enter an integer :: ");

      intOne = keyboard.nextInt();

 

      System.out.print("Enter an integer :: ");

      intTwo = keyboard.nextInt();

 

      System.out.println("integer one = " + intOne);

      System.out.println("integer two = " + intTwo);

   }

}
