**Part 1**
Your code for part one should remove the word "very" (and the related psaces) from message1 and print the new message. 

You must use .indexOf() to find the start position of a the part of the string you want to remove.

You need to use .length() to find the end point of the string you want to remove.

You can then use .substring() to create a new string removing the word.


**Part 2**
Your code for part two should replace lol in the message with laugh out loud and print the new message. You WILL NOT just change message 2 and replace lol with laugh out loud.

Here is the code to start you off: (see assignment page)
